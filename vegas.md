# Vegas
I lived in Vegas for some time. In that time, I found a bunch of fun things. I have a hard time recalling all of them on the spot, so this is a collection of my fun Vegas shit.


## Restaurants

### Mint Indian Bistro
http://mintbistro.com/ on Flamingo at Swenson
Excellent Indian food.

### Prommares
No website that I know of. On Sahara west of Jones
Great Thai food.

### Felipitos
No website that I know of. Drive-thru Mexican spot on Tropicana near Maryland.
Basically Mexican home cookin' - amazing fish tacos!

### Firefly
http://www.fireflylv.com/ A local chain tapas bar, there are a few around town.
Bacon wrapped dates? Yes, please!

### Pin Kaow
http://www.pinkaowthai.com/ A local chain Thai restaurant, there are a few around town.
Great Thai food- chili mint noodles are my favorite here.

## Outdoor Stuff

### Goldstrike Canyon
http://www.birdandhike.com/Hike/LAME/Goldstrike/_Goldstrike.htm
This is a truly fabulous hike I used to love to take people on. It's down past Boulder City, into a slot canyon and down to a set of natural hot spring pools and the Colorado River. You can also get a from-below view of the dam, if you're there at the right time of day. Super awesome great way to send folks away with a piece of Vegas that few tourists ever bother to taste. It is a bit of an aggressive adventure- quite a bit of rock tumbling- which might make it less than perfect for very little ones, but it's incredible. I was able to do it (tho, admittedly, I did feel pushed to the edge of what's possible for me), and I'm a big baby as hikes go.

### The Dam Tour
The dam tour is worth doing, especially if you don't know much about it (as I did not before I went on the tour). Very interesting, that thing.

### Valley of Fire
If you're looking for a more structured and kid-friendly park adventure, I strongly recommend Valley of Fire- about an hour north of town- leaps and bounds over Red Rock. VoF is much more beautiful, especially during sunset. Like, f'real. Also: petroglyphs! Lots of petroglyphs on the Mouse's Tank trail!

If you do VoF, I strongly recommend staying past sunset: not only is sunset gorgeous, but you're far enough out from the city that, once it gets dark, it gets DARK.. which means stars. Lots and lots of stars. It takes a while for the real dark to happen, so I'd suggest bringing some food so that you have something to do after the sun sets before it actually gets dark. One time, I was out there with friends visiting from SF... while hanging out waiting for the dark, a family of bighorn sheep came bounding down out of the hills like 20 or 30 feet from us... hung out for a bit, scavenged, and then went back up into the hills. You couldn't have bought that experience.

### Springs Preserve
http://www.springspreserve.org/
Within town, there is the Springs Preserve... basically the Las Vegas Conservatory/Botannical Gardens/CentralPark: hiking trails, cactus garden.. definitely cool. You do not have to pay to just go in and hike the gardens... you do have to pay for the exhibits, but I've never seen them, so I am unable to comment.

### Ethel M Factory Cactus Garden
The Ethel M Factory Tour and cactus garden is pretty fabulous. Ethel M was one of the aunties of the M&M&Mars kids, and it's sort of the upscale line of M&M&Mars chocolates. There's a very brief walkthrough of a put-up candy factory, complete with round ladies in white uniforms making chocolate covered apples (it's not really where the bulk of the stuff is made anymore; it's really all for show), and at the end they give you a "sample" of chocolate in the gift shop where you're free to spend money on some arguably decent chocolate.

But the real draw for me is the cactus garden outside. That ethel lady, boy howdy, was she thinking forward! She planted a wildly extensive cactus garden like ten thousand years ago or something.... some of those fuckers are enormous! Love the shit out of her! The garden alone is worth the trip, I think.


## Strip shit

I recommend staying as far away from the strip as you possibly can, but I still fancy myself a local that way. If you must do the strip...

A quick tip: remember that the valets at casinos are, strictly speaking, free. In my opinion, it's worth it to tip the valets a couple discretionary dollars every time you park to have the experience of entering the casino through the front door. The walk from the parking structures is often very long, and the things about the casino that you actually want to see are usually in the front lobby anyway. Plus some of the valets are HOTTIES! and, bonus: no keeping keys in pockets!

### The Roller Coaster at NYNY
This is THE one to do, and in my opinion is NOT to be missed if you like roller coasters. I like arriving early, getting the all-day pass (last I recall, it was $14 for 1 ride, $7 for subsequent rides, or $25 for an all day pass- an easy sell, for me), riding until either the line packs up with a bunch of people or until I feel like I may vomit if I ride one more time (2.75 consecutive hours is my personal best).. then go for a walk, come back later, and repeat. I have this as yet unrealized fantasy of dressing up in ridiculous costumes, riding in the front car, and getting souvenir shots.

### Stratosphere
The view from the Stratosphere is quite spectacular, but the rides on the roof basically suck. Fair disclaimers: (1) I do not fear heights, and they all basically prey on a fear of heights, and (2) the semi-bungee-jumpy ride was not there when I went... that one could possibly be cool, I dunno. The swings was neat, but really not worth the money.

### Bellagio
The Chihuly glass installation in the lobby of the bellagio is beautiful. Worth going in to check out, especially if you're already there checking out the the choreographed fountain display... which is.... cool, I guess? Nah, it's cool, for sure... I mean, at least once...

### Treasure Island
The outdoor performance on the pirate ship at Treasure Island is fun. The kids should get a kick out of that.

### MGM Grand
The lions on display at the MGM makes me sad. I say avoid it if only to make a statement that it's a terrible idea. That said, kids seem to get a kick out of it. Poor kitties.

### Casinos, generally
One thing to pay attention to as you visit casinos, especially strip casinos: each one has its own unique smell (and not in a bad way!). Like, I have the impression that they deliberately scent the casino air... and, like the rest of the sculpted ambiance, each one is different and intentionally selected. Kinda cool.

### Aquariums and, peripherally, buffets
The tourist-targeted things- like the shark aquarium at Mandalay- tend to be disappointing, especially for the cost. If you want to see fish, there's a coral reef tank at the Silverton- it's beautiful, and it's free! And while you're there, if you wanna do it for the experience of saying you've done it once, the Silverton has one of the best buffets for my money and mouth, especially the brunch buffet.

### Rare Car Collection
http://www.autocollections.com/
I never actually saw it, but was always told that the rare car collection at the Imperial Palace is cool (er, apparently the Imperial Palace has been reimagined as "The Quad"- always changing, Las Vegas is!). They have the Lincoln in which the Kennedys were riding when the President was assassinated, among other things. Oh, and according to the website you can get free admission if you print out a coupon online.

### Pool at the Golden Nugget
If the weather is warm enough for it, I think you can get day passes for the pool at the Golden Nugget, which has the unique bonus of a water slide through their shark tank. Should be loads of fun for the kids, weather permitting.

### Fremont Street Experience
People will advise you to see the Fremont Street Experience. It's .... kinda cool? If you're there, see it. But don't go out of your way to go there just for it.

## Music/Lounges
### Vanguard Lounge
If you're looking for good music, my best recommendation is the Vanguard Lounge in downtown. _Fabulous_ drinks- and I'm really not a drinker- and _very_ nice music.

### Ghostbar
I also had a good time at Ghostbar in the Palms, tho I was only ever there for a specific event which, sadly, no longer seems to be happening. However, Ghostbar does have the advantage of an outdoor patio on the 55th floor... so there's that.

## Off-strip local stuff
### First Friday
http://www.firstfridaylasvegas.com/
If you're lucky enough to be in town for a First Friday, there is an art walk downtown that's worth checking out. I picked up a few fun things there. I think some of the galleries are open during non-first-Friday days, but the main allure for me was always the street party atmosphere of the event... live music, street food, people having fun... plus the artists tend to actually be on hand, which is cool.

### Luv-It Frozen Custard
http://www.luvitfrozencustard.com/flavors.html
The Luv-It frozen custard stand on Oakey, just off the strip, is delicious, and sort of a local secret. Two different flavors every day, along with I think standard chocolate and vanilla. They've got a website with a calendar of flavors.

### Imperial Health Spa
If you want a nice mellow spa experience, without any fancy fanfare (or the accompanying cost), I recommend the Imperial Health Spa, on Sahara at Maryland. $20 gets you up to 12 hours of access to the whole Korean bathhouse facility.

There are two sections: gender segregated and gender integrated.

The segregated section has showers, hot and cold tubs, steam room, dry sauna, salt scrub steam room (scrub your body with salt and let it dissolve into your skin- 20 minutes is like spending a day at the beach! but make sure to ask for salt at check-in! they used to have a giant bowl sitting out for all-you-can-use, but they've recently gotten stingy with it!), and dry salt sauna (the walls are made of pink himalayan salt bricks! <3). You go nekkid on the segregated side.

Then, the gender integrated section, upstairs, has relaxxy recliners, another dry sauna, a room full of what always look to me like stoves that you, like, bake yourself in (I dunno), and the room that I actually like upstairs: the clay ball room... giant beds of heated terra cotta balls that you lay in... it's like a warm massage... totally dig it. There's also a Korean cafe upstairs. And it's an all-ages affair, so you can bring the kids (assuming you wish or need to do so).

You can also opt to buy a body scrub while you're there... I've gotten the scrub a couple times.... it's quite....... aggressive. VERY intense. Very cleansing. But VERY intense.

### The Atomic History Museum
http://www.nationalatomictestingmuseum.org/ On Flamingo, a bit east of the strip.
Among the exhibits is a "4D" video of an atomic explosion- it blows a gust of air over you in sequence with the explosion. It's kinda intense. Definitely cool in a wow I can't believe how fucked up we are as a people kind of way.

### Pinball Hall of Fame
http://www.pinballmuseum.org/
In keeping with the spirit of Las Vegas' bizarre museum culture, there's the Pinball Hall of Fame, which is a room full of pinball machines dating back to before they were all digitally fancified. I think they also have some old-school video game systems from, like, when I was a kid.

Unless you're a mega-nerd, it's probably not worth making a specific trip for it... but if you're in the area and have some time to kill, it's definitely worth the time. It is actually quite close to the airport, so it makes a perfect candidate if you're looking for something to fill an hour before you start waiting for the plane.

### Liberace Museum
Evidently, the [Liberace Museum](https://liberace.org/liberace-museum-collection/) has been reimagined as the [Liberace Garage](https://liberace.org/liberace-museum-collection/exhibits/liberace-garage-is-a-museum-space-which-hosts-events-and-performances/) and the [Liberace Museum Collection at Thriller Villa -- on VIP Invitation](https://squareup.com/market/the-liberace-foundation-for-the-performing-and-creative-arts/item/liberace-vaults-vip-backstage-pass), which is held in the private residence of a large supporter of the Liberace Foundation. The property was the final Las Vegas residence of Michael Jackson, who was a friend and collaborator of Liberace. It is not open to the public. Visiting the Museum Collection is ..... costly ($130, I assume per person :P). I don't know if it's worth that ..... but, it was pretty cool to see when it was laid out in the museum. :)
